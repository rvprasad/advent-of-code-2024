### Observations

1. Crystal's documentation is good.
2. Crystal's standard library does not seem to have method parity with Ruby's
   standard library.  For example, while Ruby's library supports `drop`,
   `drop_while`, `take`, and `take_while` method in `Array`, Crystal's library
   only supports `skip`, `skip_while`, and `take_while`.  
3. Even with prior exposure to Ruby's syntax and concepts via Groovy, the
   experience with Crystal involved some friction; possibly, due to
   observation 2 above.
