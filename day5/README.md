Execute this code via `scala day5.scala -- <filename>`.

### Observations

1. [Scaladoc](https://docs.scala-lang.org/) and [Scala API docs](https://www.scala-lang.org/api/3.3.1/) are really easy to use.
2. VS Code using [Metals](https://scalameta.org/metals/) LSP failed to recognize
   files via their soft links.
3. "Format document" command did not always work with Metals LSP.
